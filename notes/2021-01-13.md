* Graphs of graph density against time
* Possibly remove usage of induced subdigraph in Byskov by calling
MaximalIndependent sets excluding the complement of the subset.
* Ended up not working, due to the counterexamples of Cycle Digraph with a 1
element subset. The issue is that with the induced subgraph there is only
one vertex, which is a maximal indepenent set. Even with excluding all other
vertices, the single element isn't a maximal independent set as it is contained
in other maximal independent sets.
* I believe it still works for Byskovs, as these small sets would have already
been coloured by the previous checks.
* Tested out improvements. Made a large difference to Lawlers, but not as much
of a difference to Byskovs. Going to try out enumerating maximal independent
sets of each range value as a current "fix".
